# cpace

A Rust implementation of the CPace PAKE, instantiated with the
ristretto255 group.

This implementation is based on the
[go-cpace-ristretto255](https://github.com/FiloSottile/go-cpace-ristretto255)
implementation by Filippo Valsorda, and attempts to be compatible with it.
Note that *that* implementation is loosely based on draft-haase-cpace-01, so all of these implementations are something of a moving target.
